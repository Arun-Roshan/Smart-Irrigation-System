# Smart Irrigation System with OLED Display & Buzzer ðŸŒ±

This is a simple smart irrigation system using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU), an OLED display, a soil moisture sensor, and a buzzer. The system continuously monitors soil moisture levels and alerts the user when the soil is too dry by activating a buzzer and displaying a warning on the OLED screen.

**Features**

âœ… Real-time soil moisture monitoring.

âœ… OLED display with moisture percentage & graphical bar.

âœ… Buzzer alert for dry soil.

âœ… Compact and low-power solution.

**Hardware Components**

-> ESP8266 (NodeMCU)

-> Soil Moisture Sensor

-> 0.96" OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)

-> Buzzer

-> Jumper Wires

**Libraries Used**

You need to install the following libraries in the Arduino IDE:

-> Adafruit SSD1306 - (Install from Library Manager)

-> Adafruit GFX - (Required for OLED display)

-> Wire.h - (Default Arduino library for I2C communication)

**Wiring Connections (ESP8266 - NodeMCU)**

**How It Works**

-> The soil moisture sensor reads the moisture level of the soil.

-> The OLED display shows the percentage of soil moisture along with a visual bar indicator.

-> If the soil moisture drops below 30%, the buzzer is activated to alert the user.

-> The system updates every 2 seconds.

**Future Enhancements**

ðŸ”¹ Add WiFi & IoT connectivity for remote monitoring.

ðŸ”¹ Send notifications to a mobile app when moisture is low.

ðŸ”¹ Implement automatic irrigation control by adding a relay & water pump.
